    <h1>Top Tips for Effective Presentations</h1>
    <p>This page draws on published<strong>advice</strong> from expert presenters around the world,
        which will help to take your presentations from merely<strong>good</strong> to<strong>great.</strong></p>
    <p>By bringing together advice from a<strong>wide range of people</strong>,<em>the aim is to cover a whole range of areas.</em></p>
    <p>Whether you are an experienced presenter, or just starting out, there should be ideas here to help you to<strong>improve.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>It’s hard to be relaxed and be yourself when you’re nervous.</strong></p>
    <p>But time and again, the great presenters say that<strong>the most important thing</strong> is to connect with your audience,
        and the best way to do that is to let your passion for the subject shine through.</p>
    <p><em>Be honest with the audience about what is important to you and why it matters.</em></p>
    <p><strong>Your presentation needs to be built around what your audience is going to get out of the presentation.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>As you prepare the presentation</strong>, you always need to bear in mind
        what the audience needs and wants to know, not what you can tell them.</p>
    <p><em>While you’re giving the presentation, you also need to remain focused on your audience’s response, and react to that.</em></p>
